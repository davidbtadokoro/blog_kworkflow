My GSoC23 journey, which I introduced in a [previous post](https://davidbtadokoro.github.io/posts/got-accepted-into-gsoc-2023/),
is almost over. It really doesn't feel like 16 weeks have passed, but I can say that,
in this period, I have learned a lot and grown as a developer.

My proposal was to develop a feature for the [kw project](https://kworkflow.org) that
served as a hub for patches in <https://lore.kernel.org>, an archive for public mailing
lists related to Linux kernel.

This feature is named `kw patch-hub`, and this blog post is a "final report" of my GSoC23
contributions.

## **Non-related Contributions**

---

This first section describes my contributions to kw that are not directly related to the
`kw patch-hub` feature but were part of my GSoC23. Nonetheless, these were important in
their own context and made me more in sync with kw coding style, its contribution model,
and, most importantly, with my mentors and people around the project (which I found most
invaluable).

### **Adding Support for Native Zsh Completions**

I contributed meaningful changes to kw project during the application period. My first
significant contribution (both in scope and number of commits) was adding support for
native Zsh completions. Without getting into too much detail, each Shell, say, Bash, can
provide command completions. In other words, it's the well-known behavior of hitting `TAB`
and waiting for the Shell to either complete the command you are typing or show possible
completions.

These completions are Shell-dependent, and kw only had native support for Bash completions.
Zsh completions were adapted from the native Bash completions, but this "emulation" didn't
work and resulted in broken completions for Zsh. This was a waste, as the Zsh completion
system provided deeper features than Bash, like highlighting options shown, coupling
documentation with options shown, and more.

During February I worked on bringing kw support for native Zsh completions. I described
this in further detail in an [earlier post](https://davidbtadokoro.github.io/posts/adding-support-for-native-zsh-completions/),
but you can see the full Pull Request with 29 commits by clicking [here](https://github.com/kworkflow/kworkflow/pull/773).
To illustrate, below is a demo of the results achieved.

### **Introducing SQLite3 to kw**

From before the Community Bonding Period began until halfway through it (from mid-April
to mid-May), I worked on introducing the Database Management System (DBMS) SQLite3 to kw.
This was a long-awaited addition for the kw community, as it would improve the project's
scalability and allow the collection of statistics.

I discussed this in further detail in an [earlier post](https://davidbtadokoro.github.io/posts/introducing-sqlite3-to-kw/)
and the full Pull Request with 14 commits representing this contribution can be accessed
[here](https://github.com/kworkflow/kworkflow/pull/836).

I really want to stress that I didn't work on this contribution alone, as the whole
database schema was made by [Rubens Gomes Neto](https://github.com/kwy95) and [Magali Lemes](https://github.com/magalilemes),
and the base of the migration script and library functions was made by Rubens Gomes Neto.
My work was built upon theirs and I worked on refining little details of the schema,
finishing the migration script, and, mainly, integrating the database all around the project.

### **Other Non-Related Contributions**

Throughout the year, I also contributed all around the kw project. Below is a list of
every merged Pull Request concerning other work not related to my main GSoC23 project.
Note that these PRs appear as *Closed*, but that is because the project's maintainers
clone the PR locally, commit themselves the changes, and close the PR.

## **kw patch-hub**

---

My project focus was to add a feature to kw that was a terminal-based User Interface to
the <https://lore.kernel.org> archives with patch-reviewing in mind. In my proposal, I
listed the following deliverables for `kw patch-hub`:

1. A user-friendly interface to patchsets in the lore archives.
2. Capabilities of downloading, applying, building, and deploying patchsets.
3. Capabilities of replying patchsets in the public mailing lists with Reviewed-by,
Tested-by, and inline reviews.

> I use the term *patchset* instead of *patch*, because a patchset is a logical set of
patches pertaining to the same context, while a patch is any individual change sent as
a message. For reviewing, considering chunks of related changes instead of individual
changes makes more sense. Just think of reviewing a Pull Request in its whole context,
versus reviewing the commits of this PR independently.

### **First Cycle: Understanding the Problem and Building the Core**

Since my proposal, my better understanding of the problem at hand along with my
interactions with my mentors, made me realize that the most important deliverable was
to provide a reliable UI to lore.

We didn't plan on having strict development cycles, but looking in hindsight, I can
divide my work on `kw patch-hub` into 3 development cycles. The first cycle was related
to experimenting and understanding the problem and building the feature's core.

##### How we kept Organized

From an organizational perspective, we documented every starting requisite in issues
and added them to a GitHub Kanbam board. Below is a print of it, just for illustration
purposes, but you can check its live state [here](https://github.com/orgs/kworkflow/projects/2).

![kw patch-hub Kanbam]({{site.url}}/images/kw_patch_hub_kanbam.png)

Every time we encountered some kind of bug, or discussed/thought of a possible
improvement, we added an entry to the 'To Do' list, even if was just a draft that would
promptly altered or removed. This sort of "protocol" was really important to keep track
of what needed to be done.

##### Studying and Expanding the Code

From the code perspective, I focused on understanding what was already done, what needed
to be done, what needed to change, and built the core of `kw patch-hub`. About two years
ago, my mentors [Rodrigo Siqueira](https://siqueira.tech/) and [Melissa Wen](https://melissawen.github.io/)
implemented what we can call the "predecessor" of `kw patch-hub` named `kw upstream-patches-ui`.
This was mostly a prototype that validated the feature, but that laid the foundation
needed for my project.

At the end of this cycle, `kw patch-hub` started to look functional and the feature
software architecture was somewhat solidified (although, as we will see in a moment,
kind of messy). At that moment, the feature was still named `kw upstream-patches-ui`
and looked like this:

We came to a working version but decided to not introduce this enhancement before
cleaning the code. Nevertheless, this PR produced some good commits that were merged
into the project:

- [src: lib: dialog_ui.sh: Add 'Yes/No' prompt screen](https://github.com/kworkflow/kworkflow/commit/8204f42ace2cfb1ed6eee3122a257b2be0a581d0)

{: .prompt-info }

##### Time to Clean

`kw patch-hub` had its core screens implemented (Dashboard, Registered Mailing Lists,
Bookmarked Patchsets, Settings, Latests Patchsets), but it lacked a reliable fetch
strategy of patchsets from lore, that limited patchsets from a hardcoded period of
time, and the whole feature needed a refactoring, as its architecture was starting
to break and the code had some bad smells.

### **Second Cycle: Refactoring**

As mentioned, `kw patch-hub` had a core implemented, however, the feature badly
needed refactoring.

At this point, the feature was implemented across three files: 2 library files
(`src/lib/lore.sh` and `src/lib/dialog_ui.sh`) and one that represented the feature
itself (`src/upstream_patches_ui.sh`). The Model-View-Controller was softly implemented
in a way that `src/lib/lore.sh` was the Model, `src/lib/dialog_ui.sh` was the View, and
`src/upstream_patches_ui.sh` was the Controller.

##### Refactoring the Controller

I described in a [previous post](https://davidbtadokoro.github.io/posts/the-finite-state-machine-in-kw-patch-hub/)
the Finite-State Machine computation model used to implement `kw patch-hub` Controller,
but the thing was that for each new state added, `src/upstream_patches_ui.sh` grew
uncontrollably. At one moment, the file was more than 500 lines in size with functions
that didn't follow a logical order, which made it harder and harder to scroll to the
desired line each time an addition was made. To exemplify the need for refactoring on
this Controller front, there was a `switch-case` with more than 100 lines.

The Controller refactoring was made by taking advantage of the Finite-State Machine
model implemented and breaking down the file into smaller files that roughly represented
the states. Thanks to these extractions that resulted in great modularity, both maintaining
and expanding the feature was made much easier from this point onward, as I could
isolate problems to single files, lower the complexity and coupling of the code, whilst
also introducing somewhat of a pattern for Finite-State Machines to kw project.

Now the Controller files are stored in `src/ui/patch_hub` and look like this:

![kw patch-hub Controller Refactoring]({{site.url}}/images/kw_patch_hub_controller_refactoring.png)

##### Refactoring the View

Another badly needed refactoring was in the View front. The file `src/dialog_ui.sh`
mostly stored library functions to create [dialog](https://linux.die.net/man/1/dialog)
boxes. These dialog boxes are the means through which `kw patch-hub` displays screens,
hence, the View role the file performed (it is worth noting that this role is from
`kw patch-hub` perspective, as the library file should be general enough to be used
all around the kw project).

These functions were really similar and two actions that were exactly the same in each
and every one of them were: building the preamble of the dialog command and evaluating
the dialog command built. These two actions were extracted to functions, reducing a lot
of duplicated code, whilst also allowing for more fine-grained testing. In the refactoring,
I took the opportunity to also enforce some patterns in the View.

##### Defining the feature's new name

This may not be a refactoring, but as we are essentially changing names to improve the
feature, I will consider it here. The name change was urged since the start of GSoC,
and in this second cycle moment, we decided to pull the trigger. I opened a [poll](https://github.com/kworkflow/kworkflow/discussions/872)
to decide the feature's new name and `kw patch-hub` was elected.

##### Contributions of Second Cycle

From mid-June up until the start of August, those were my contributions in the form
of Pull Requests, in chronological order of merge:

| Pull Request | Nº of commits |
|--------------|:---------------:|
| [upstream-patches-ui: Controller refactoring](https://github.com/kworkflow/kworkflow/pull/874) | 3 |
| [src: patch_hub: Rename upstream-patches-ui feature to patch-hub](https://github.com/kworkflow/kworkflow/pull/877) | 1 |
| [patch-hub: Revise 'Patchsets Details and Actions' screen](https://github.com/kworkflow/kworkflow/pull/878) | 7 |
| [patch-hub: Refactor lore mailing lists screen](https://github.com/kworkflow/kworkflow/pull/885) | 4 |
| [src/lib/dialog_ui: Reduce duplicated code and add pattern to file](https://github.com/kworkflow/kworkflow/pull/888) | 4 |

| [src: ui: patch_hub: patch_hub_core: Fix 'Registered Mailing Lists' message box](https://github.com/kworkflow/kworkflow/pull/895) | 1 |

### **Third Cycle: Consolidating Interaction with Lore API**

After the two first cycles, we tackled what was considered from the onset of the program
the critical point: the interactions with lore API, especially to fetch an arbitrary
number of patchsets reliably, allowing the user to potentially navigate all of a mailing
list history. It is important to note that, in case this problem couldn't be solved, the
whole feature would be jeopardized as its functionality would be really limited.

##### The Problem and the Solution

I plan on making a more detailed post on the lore API, but in summary, lore provides a
search engine powered by [Xapian](https://xapian.org/) that allows us to make queries
to match specific messages in a given public mailing list archived.

The implementation, at this point, used a hardcoded period of time (last 2 days) to
query lore for patches and we needed a way to fetch adjacent chunks of patchsets that
had a consistent order.

After deeply studying the lore API, or, should I say, reverse-engineering it, I came
up with an answer that both solved the problem and eliminated the need for managing
timestamps to get consistent chunks of patchsets.

##### Current Merged State of kw patch-hub

All this blabber aside, below is a demo of using `kw patch-hub` to navigate through
the *amd-gfx* list history. This demo is the current merged state of `kw patch-hub`.
Notice that the feature paginates the patchsets and doesn't do redundant fetches when
going back on pages.

##### Contributions of Third Cycle

This whole cycle is contained on this Pull Request with 9 commits that was active from
the start of August until some days ago:

[kw patch-hub: Add reliable fetch of latest patchsets from mailing list](https://github.com/kworkflow/kworkflow/pull/889)

<br>

## **Next Steps**

---

As a result of my GSoC project, `kw patch-hub` can be used as a reliable UI to
the lore archives and provides some other functionalities like bookmarking patchsets,
downloading applicable patchsets (to a default or custom directory), and managing
the feature's settings through the feature itself.

It's important to note that `kw patch-hub` has become an integral part of my Capstone
Project, so I'll keep updating the feature until the end of this year, and probably
further than that.

Here is a list, not in order of importance, of the next steps to take that will make
`kw patch-hub` incrementally better. By tackling all of these, I firmly believe the
feature will provide a solid experience for users, especially for patch-reviewing.

1. Optimize fetch time. In the demo GIF above you can see that loading times are not good.
2. Fix parsing of patchsets. In the demo GIF above you can see some patchsets metadata
malformatted/incorrect.
3. Add an 'Apply' action for patchsets. 
4. Add a 'Build' action for patchsets.
5. Add a 'Deploy' action for patchsets.
6. Add query based on string. In other words, integrate a more refined search of lore
archives on the feature.
7. Allow users to reply patchsets with 'Reviewed-by', 'Tested-by', and with inline reviews.
8. Improve feature UX.
9. Refine feature fixing bugs.
10. Improve loading screens. They are static and don't give much feedback to the user.

First, I want to give special thanks to my mentors Rodrigo Siqueira, Melissa Wen, Paulo
Meirelles, and Magali Lemes. They were always very attentive and open to communication.
They also were really considerate of me when giving feedback and would often take a step
back to explain concepts or point me in the right direction. I couldn't wish for better
mentors, so thank you all so much.

I also want to thank my colleague Aquila Macedo who also actively contributes to kw and
was there at every weekly kw meeting.

Finally, I want to thank The Linux Foundation for giving kw and me the opportunity to
participate in GSoC23.
